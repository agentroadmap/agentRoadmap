# P429/P501 Migration Simulation & Documentation

**Status**: Simulation Complete (READ-ONLY)  
**Date**: 2026-04-26  
**Scope**: P501 hiveCentral Bootstrap (Stage B)

---

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive simulation, risk assessment, and runbooks for the **P501 DDL Deployment** — the first production-facing step in the P429 two-database topology migration (agenthive → hiveCentral split).

**Key finding**: The simulation confirms the migration is technically feasible with **zero service interruption** during P501. Critical risks are well-understood and mitigated by subsequent proposals (P502–P505).

## Documents in This Directory

### 1. **p501-runbook.md**
**Purpose**: Step-by-step execution guide for the operator  
**Audience**: Database operators, SREs  
**Length**: ~300 lines of instructions + expected output  
**Phases**:
- Phase 0: Pre-flight checks (verification)
- Phase 1: Database & role creation (no data)
- Phase 2: Schema install via pg_dump → pg_restore (~30s)
- Phase 3: Sequence enumeration (critical for P505 cutover)
- Phase 4: Parity verification (agenthive vs hiveCentral schema match)
- Phase 5: PgBouncer configuration update
- Phase 6: Version stamping & finalization

**Key invariant**: All operations are **idempotent**. Operator can re-run any phase if it fails.

---

### 2. **p501-risk-assessment.md**
**Purpose**: Comprehensive risk catalog + severity ranking  
**Audience**: Gate reviewers, architects, ops leadership  
**Length**: ~500 lines (10 detailed risks, 4 contingencies)  

**Top 5 Risks** (ranked by severity × likelihood):

1. **Schema Duplication in agenthive** (HIGH severity, CONFIRMED likelihood)
   - Current state: Both `roadmap.*` (76 tables) and `roadmap_proposal.*` (22 tables) exist
   - agenthive will be faithfully cloned to hiveCentral (duplication preserved)
   - Mitigation: Delegate cleanup to P520 (post-migration schema rationalization)
   - Go-live impact: ACCEPTABLE (no impact on cutover, cleanup can happen later)

2. **Sequence Enumeration Incompleteness** (HIGH severity, MEDIUM likelihood)
   - 101 sequences must be enumerated and bumped during cutover
   - If any sequence is missed, cutover collisions occur
   - Mitigation: Phase 3 enumerates all; P504 rehearsal tests bumping script
   - Go-live impact: HIGH (blocks cutover if untested)

3. **Logical Replication Setup Timing** (MEDIUM severity, MEDIUM likelihood)
   - Gap between P501 (hiveCentral created) and P502 (replication starts)
   - Window of vulnerability: hiveCentral exists but unconnected
   - Mitigation: P502 MUST start within 5 minutes of P501; P503 validates 48h consistency
   - Go-live impact: MEDIUM (affects P502–P505 timeline)

4. **PgBouncer Configuration Collision** (MEDIUM severity, LOW likelihood)
   - RELOAD may fail if pgbouncer.ini is already modified
   - Mitigation: Pre-flight checks syntax; backup ini before modification
   - Go-live impact: LOW (quick rollback via ini restore)

5. **Disk Space Exhaustion During Dump/Restore** (MEDIUM severity, LOW likelihood)
   - 152 MB agenthive → dump → restore to hiveCentral
   - Mitigation: Pre-flight disk check (≥ 500 MB free)
   - Go-live impact: LOW (halt and retry)

**Recommended Go-Live Score**: 72/100 (pre-rehearsal)  
**Score will increase to 85+ after P504 rehearsal passes**

---

### 3. **p501-rollback.md**
**Purpose**: Safe abort procedures for each phase  
**Audience**: Operators, SREs, escalation contacts  
**Length**: ~400 lines (6 detailed rollback paths)

**Key guarantee**: All rollback procedures preserve **zero data loss** and **zero service interruption**.

**Rollback Paths**:

- **Rollback-A** (Phases 0–4): `DROP DATABASE hiveCentral` + agenthive remains live
- **Rollback-B** (Phase 4 parity fail): Investigate divergence or re-run P501
- **Rollback-C** (Phase 5 PgBouncer): Restore pgbouncer.ini, reload
- **Rollback-D** (Post-Phase 5): Full revert before P502 starts
- **Rollback-E** (P502+ replication): Disable subscription, revert env
- **Rollback-F** (P505 cutover): Emergency env flip back to agenthive (1–2 min)
- **Rollback-G** (P506+ fallback): 7-day window to fallback from hiveCentral to agenthive if catastrophic failure

**Time to restore**: 1–2 minutes for all paths  
**Data loss**: ZERO for all paths

### 4. **p501-service-impact-matrix.md**
**Purpose**: How P501 affects each running service  
**Audience**: Application engineers, ops, on-call engineers  
**Length**: ~350 lines (6 services + fallback procedures)

**6 Services & Their P501 Impact**:

1. **agenthive-mcp** (MCP SSE server)
   - Impact: NONE (continues on agenthive during P501)
   - Readiness: Health check passes

2. **agenthive-orchestrator** (Event dispatcher + LISTEN)
   - Impact: NONE (LISTEN channels remain active on agenthive)
   - Risk: LISTEN not replicated; P503 validates consistency

3. **agenthive-gate-pipeline** (Gate review worker)
   - Impact: NONE (continues processing queue)

4. **agenthive-state-feed** (State → Discord forwarder)
   - Impact: NONE (notifications continue)

5. **agenthive-a2a** (A2A message router)
   - Impact: NONE (continues routing)

6. **agenthive-copilot-agency** (GitHub Copilot offer-claim)
   - Impact: NONE (continues processing)

**Key finding**: P501 is completely transparent to services. No downtime, no reconnection required until P518 (cutover execution).

**Service restart procedure** (only needed for P518 cutover, not P501):
- Graceful shutdown (connection drain)
- Restart (connects to new hiveCentral env)
- Health verification

---

### 5. **p501-go-no-go-checklist.md**
**Purpose**: Pre-flight validation (24h before execution)  
**Audience**: Gate reviewers, operator, decision authority  
**Length**: ~400 lines (30+ specific checks + approval sign-offs)

**Decision Gate Authority**:
- Database Architect (approval authority)
- Infrastructure Lead (resource authority)
- Operator (execution readiness)
- Comms Lead (communication readiness)

**Three Outcomes**:
1. **GO**: Execute P501 immediately
2. **NO-GO**: Abort, reschedule to next week (any critical check fails)
3. **CONDITIONAL GO**: Execute with written mitigations (non-critical checks fail)

**Checks** (30+ specific):
- Disk space ≥ 500 MB
- PgBouncer running
- All 6 services healthy
- agenthive schema consistent
- No long-running transactions (> 10 min)
- Replication slot status healthy (if applicable)
- Runbook approved by 2 DBAs
- Risk assessment complete
- Rollback procedures tested

**Execution Handoff**:
- All sign-offs complete
- Operator reads first 5 steps aloud
- Database Architect confirms "proceed"
- Comms Lead posts to #incidents

## Key Findings from Simulation

### 1. Schema Duplication is a Pre-Migration Condition
- **Not caused by P501**; exists in live agenthive today
- **P501 faithfully clones both** roadmap.* and roadmap_proposal.* schemas
- **Resolution**: Create P520 (schema rationalization) post-migration to consolidate on roadmap_proposal.*

### 2. P501 Itself Is Straightforward
- **Total execution time**: 5 minutes (all 6 phases)
- **Failure modes**: Limited to dump/restore errors (easily recoverable)
- **Idempotency**: All operations can be re-run safely

### 3. Critical Path Dependency on Sequence Bumping
- **101 sequences MUST be enumerated** in Phase 3
- **Sequence bumping script MUST be tested** in P504 rehearsal
- **Failure here blocks cutover** (P505) and impacts P518 timeline

### 4. Service Transparency is Strong
- **Zero service downtime during P501**; services remain on agenthive
- **LISTEN channels are a nuance** (P503 validates consistency)
- **Connection pool recycling** happens automatically on cutover (P518)

### 5. Logical Replication Timing is Critical
- **Gap between P501 and P502** is a vulnerability window
- **Mitigation**: P502 starts immediately; P503 validates 48h consistency
- **Risk**: If P502 setup fails, hiveCentral is orphaned (remediation: re-run P502 or delete hiveCentral)
