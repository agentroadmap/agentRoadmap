### Summary

| Proposal | Decision | Reason |
|----------|----------|--------|
| P163 | HOLD | MERGE→COMPLETE blocked — ACs corrupted (character-split), all pending |
| P164 | HOLD | MERGE→COMPLETE blocked — ACs corrupted (character-split), all pending |
| P165 | HOLD | MERGE→COMPLETE blocked — ACs corrupted (character-split), all pending |
| P166 | HOLD | MERGE→COMPLETE blocked — ACs all pending (7 ACs, properly structured) |
| P167 | ADVANCE | TRIAGE→FIX — Well-scoped, clear root cause, ready for implementation |
| P168 | ADVANCE | TRIAGE→FIX — Column mismatch identified with exact DDL mapping |
| P169 | ADVANCE | TRIAGE→FIX — Critical blocking issue, clear failure pattern |
| P046 | HOLD | DEVELOP — maturity=active, ACs pending |
| P047 | HOLD | DEVELOP — maturity=active, ACs pending |
| P048 | HOLD | DEVELOP — maturity=active, ACs pending |
| P066 | HOLD | DEVELOP — maturity=mature but ACs all pending |
| P067 | HOLD | DEVELOP — maturity=active, ACs pending |
| P068 | HOLD | DEVELOP — maturity=active, ACs pending |

### Details

#### MERGE Proposals — AC Blocker
P163, P164, P165 have corrupted ACs: the acceptance criteria text was character-split into individual single-character AC entries (e.g., AC-1: "g", AC-2: "e", AC-3: "t" — spelling out the description). This is a known bug (P156 fixed the insertion side). The corrupted ACs cannot be verified. Until ACs are re-created properly, MERGE→COMPLETE is blocked.

P166 has 7 properly structured ACs but all are pending. None have pass/fail verification. MERGE→COMPLETE requires all ACs to pass.

No commits reference P163-P166 in git history — implementation evidence is missing.

#### TRIAGE→FIX Advances
P167, P168, P169 all have detailed root cause analysis and clear fix scope. TRIAGE→FIX requires only "accepted" (role: any, no AC gate). Advanced to FIX for agent pickup.

#### DEVELOP Proposals Held
P046, P047, P048, P067, P068 are maturity=active — not ready for MERGE.
P066 is maturity=mature but all ACs are pending — cannot advance without AC verification.

### Summary

|----------|----------|--------|
| P167 | HOLD | FIX maturity=new, no code committed |
| P168 | HOLD | FIX maturity=new, no code committed |
| P169 | HOLD | FIX maturity=new, no code committed |
| P163 | HOLD | MERGE but corrupted ACs (P156 bug), no git branches/commits |

### Details

**No proposals advanced this run.**

#### TRIAGE → FIX
No TRIAGE proposals found. P167, P168, P169 already in FIX state from prior run.

#### FIX → DEPLOYED
All three FIX proposals (P167, P168, P169) remain at maturity=new with no code committed:
- **P167:** Gate pipeline rubber-stamps transitions — critical for audit trail integrity
- **P168:** Skeptic gate decisions fail to record — audit_log column name mismatch (`actor` vs `changed_by`)
- **P169:** Gate pipeline spawnAgent fails — 'Not logged in' on every transition

None can advance: FIX→DEPLOYED requires maturity=mature AND all ACs verified. These need implementation work first.

#### DEVELOP → MERGE
No changes from prior run. All DEVELOP proposals (P046-P048, P066-P068) have maturity=active. Gate requires maturity=mature.

#### MERGE → COMPLETE
**P163, P164, P165, P166** are all at MERGE with maturity=mature, but ALL have corrupted acceptance criteria — the P156 `add_acceptance_criteria` character-splitting bug produced hundreds of single-character AC items (e.g., AC-1: "g", AC-2: "e", AC-3: "t" spelling "get_dependencies returns..."). This is the same pattern documented in prior gate evaluations.

Additionally, no git branches or commits exist for any of these proposals. Implementation evidence is absent.

The MERGE→COMPLETE gate requires all ACs to pass. With corrupted ACs, `transition_proposal` will reject the transition. `prop_transition` could bypass but would be inappropriate without actual implementation evidence.

**Recommendation:** P156 (`add_acceptance_criteria` character-splitting bug) must be fixed before these proposals can advance through any AC-gated transition. Until then, all MERGE proposals with corrupted ACs are permanently blocked.

## Summary

- **Proposals advanced:** 0
- **Proposals held:** 10
- **Key blockers:**
  1. **P163–P166 MERGE→COMPLETE blocked:** Acceptance criteria were corrupted by the P156 character-splitting bug. ACs show individual characters instead of proper criteria text. Until ACs are re-created with correct text and verified as pass, these cannot advance through the COMPLETE gate (requires all ACs pass).
  2. **P167–P169 FIX→DEPLOYED blocked:** These are new issues in FIX with no acceptance criteria and no committed code. They need work before they can be deployed.
  3. **P046–P048, P067–P068 DEVELOP→MERGE blocked:** No evidence of recent development work or committed code on these proposals.

## Action Items

1. **CRITICAL:** Re-create ACs for P163, P164, P165, P166 with proper text (not character-split). The P156 fix (`394982f`) addressed the root cause but did not clean up existing corrupted ACs.
2. P167, P168, P169 need ACs and implementation before they can move to DEPLOYED.
3. P066 has recent commits on main (`a53cbe3`) — may be ready for MERGE once ACs are verified.
