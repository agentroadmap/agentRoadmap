# Control Plane Design Notes

This folder holds design notes for the AgentHive control-plane architecture. The canonical lifecycle records live in MCP/Postgres (CONVENTIONS.md §0); these files are synced projections.

## Parent

- **P429** — AgentHive Control Plane: dedicated `agenthive_control` DB + per-project DBs on one Postgres instance (component)

## Companion Architecture Docs

- `../control-plane-multi-project-architecture.md` — boundary, entity model, dispatch flow, migration phases, non-negotiable invariants
- `../control-plane-ddl-sketch.md` — schema-qualified DDL for the 10 control schemas with constraints, indexes, views (1293 lines)
- `../provider-budget-context-plane.md` — token_plan / api_key_plan / subscription / local enforcement, model catalog vs route, seven-gate routing pipeline, credential vault, context policy hierarchy (649 lines)

## Build Order Suggestion

1. **Foundation** — P430, P431 (boundary classification + control DB creation)
2. **Schema cleanup** — P436 (reconciliation), P446 (MCP reliability)
3. **Project isolation** — P432 (per-project DBs + PoolManager extending P300)
4. **Dispatch hardening core** — P433, P437, P438, P439, P440 (dedupe, idempotency, fail-closed, ceilings, retry)
5. **Provider plane** — P434, P444 (provider accounts, routes, budgets, host separation)
6. **Service topology** — P441 (one owner per responsibility)
7. **Operator surface** — P443, P442, P435 (causal IDs → stop controls → control panels)
8. **Verification** — P445 (race integration tests), P447 (cubic path repair)

## Editing Discipline

- The MCP/Postgres row for each Pxxx is the lifecycle source of truth: status, maturity, AC, dependencies, reviews, discussions live there.
- These files capture the **design context** behind each proposal — narrative, rationale, sketches.
- Update both together when the design evolves: change the design note in this folder AND `prop_update` the MCP record.
- Do not rename these files when an MCP transition happens; the filename is stable, only the MCP `status`/`maturity` change.
