# Business Architecture & Value Chain

To build a high-performance, 100-agent enterprise, the **Business Architecture** must treat the "Agent Workforce" as a set of scalable **Capabilities** rather than just "scripts." In **agentRoadmap**, the Business domain bridges your high-level vision with the technical execution in SpacetimeDB.

In 2026, we use the **"Value Stream"** model. Every dollar spent on an LLM must correlate to a specific business outcome.

---

## The Business Domain Directory (`business/`)
This folder houses the "Strategy Artifacts" that the **Architect Agent** reads to understand *why* it is building a specific product.

* **`business/strategy.md`**: Your 12-month vision, target market, and "North Star" metrics.
* **`business/processes/`**: BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) maps. These are the "Railway Tracks" your agents follow.
* **`business/capabilities.md`**: A map of what your "Company" can actually do (e.g., "Automated Code Review," "Market Research," "Token Arbitrage").

---

## The "Agentic" Value Chain
For your overhaul, we organize the business logic into four distinct layers:

### **A. Visionary Layer (The Gary Layer)**
* **Input:** High-level directives ("Build a Material Science analyzer").
* **Output:** Strategic goals and budget envelopes.
* **Interface:** WebSash & Mobile App.

### **B. Orchestration Layer (The "Middle Office")**
* **Role:** The **Architect (`ARCH-01`)** and **PM Agent**.
* **Function:** Translates Business Strategy into the **9-stage RFC Lifecycle**. It decides which Squads to hire based on the `workforce/` profiles.
* **Artifacts:** `product/RFCs`.

### **C. Execution Layer (The "Production Floor")**
* **Role:** **Coders**, **Researchers**, and **Testers**.
* **Function:** High-frequency task completion via **OpenClaw** and **MCP**.
* **Artifacts:** `pipeline/` code, `context/` memory, and `infrastructure/` configs.

### **D. Governance Layer (The "Back Office")**
* **Role:** **Auditor (`FIN-01`)** and **Skeptic (`RED-01`)**.
* **Function:** Real-time spending control, compliance checks, and pulse monitoring.
* **Artifacts:** `spending/` ledgers and `workforce/pulse_log`.

## The Business Process State Machine
Every "Project" in **agentRoadmap** follows a standardized business flow:

1. **Opportunity Discovery:** Researcher agents find a gap (e.g., a missing feature).
2. **Feasibility Study:** Auditor agent estimates the **ROI (Return on Investment)** vs. **Token Cost**.
3. **RFC Proposal:** Architect agent drafts the proposal.
4. **Governance Gate:** Skeptic agent red-teams the idea; Gary approves via Mobile.
5. **Production:** Coder agents build; Pipeline validates.
6. **Value Realization:** The artifact is promoted to `main` and synced to Git.

---

## Business Metrics for the 100-Agent Team
Your **WebSash** should track these three "Business Health" indicators:

* **Token ROI:** (Value of Artifact Produced) / (USD Spent on LLMs).
* **Workforce Velocity:** Average time for an RFC to move from `New` to `Complete`.
* **Knowledge Density:** The ratio of **Cache Hits** in the `spending/` domain (indicates how well agents are reusing `context/` rather than re-learning).

---

### Stakeholder Integration
Since your sons, Derek and Nolan, are involved, you can treat them as **"Stakeholders"** in the Business domain:
* **Derek (Material Science/AI):** Acts as the **Subject Matter Expert (SME)**. Agents must send their `product/` RFCs to him for "Domain Validation."
* **Nolan (UX/Design):** Acts as the **User Proxy**. Agents must show him the **TUI/WebSash** mockups for "Usability Approval."

This turns **agentRoadmap** into a "Family DAO" (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) where agents handle the labor, and the humans provide the strategic and creative direction.
