-- Migration 066 — P704 lease-maturity triggers
--
-- Problem (audit 2026-04-28):
--   95 proposals at maturity='active' have ZERO alive leases. Root cause:
--   1. fn_sync_proposal_maturity force-sets maturity='active' on status
--      transitions into DEVELOP/REVIEW/MERGE/FIX/ESCALATE — so "active" has
--      meant "mid-workflow," not "has alive claim."
--   2. proposal_lease release fires NO maturity update — gates can't see
--      ready-for-review proposals because they sit at maturity='active'.
--   3. P409 terminal guard skips maturity reset on COMPLETE — 23 rows are
--      double-stuck at status=COMPLETE/maturity=active.
--
-- Fix: redefine "active" as "has alive lease," enforced by triggers on
-- proposal_lease. Status sync still owns the obsolete/new mapping but
-- never touches active.
--
-- Idempotent: drops triggers/functions before recreating; safe to re-run.
--
-- NOTE: fn_sync_proposal_maturity MUST be created in the `roadmap` schema
-- because trg_proposal_maturity_sync is OID-bound to roadmap.fn_sync_proposal_maturity()
-- (confirmed: database/ddl/roadmap-baseline-2026-04-13.sql:5715).
