/**
 * P674 caller-facing API for emitting notifications.
 *
 * Callers write `(severity, kind, title, body, payload)`. They MUST NOT pass a
 * transport/channel — the router resolves that from notification_route.
 *
 * For the deprecation window, code that still wants to short-circuit to a
 * specific transport may pass `legacyChannel`, which writes the existing
 * `channel` column. New code should never use this.
