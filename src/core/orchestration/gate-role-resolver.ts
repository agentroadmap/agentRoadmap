/**
 * P609: Per-(type × gate) gate-role resolver.
 *
 * Resolves the agent profile for a given (proposal_type, gate) pair.
 * Two-tier lookup: DB cache → BUILTIN_FALLBACK (identical to GATE_ROLES in orchestrator.ts).
 * Two-level mutex mirrors StateNamesRegistry pattern in state-names.ts:
 *   - Instance-level inner guard: GateRoleRegistry.loadInFlight serializes load() calls.
 *   - Module-level outer guard: resolvingPromise serializes getGateRoleRegistry() calls.
 *
 * NOTIFY-triggered cache invalidation: GateRoleRegistry subscribes to the
 * 'gate_role_changed' channel and reloads on each notification.
 *
 * Phase 1 (P609): shadow-mode only. orchestrator.ts still uses GATE_ROLES as
 * authoritative source and logs divergence. Phase 2 removes GATE_ROLES after
 * ≥24h shadow-mode zero-divergence window (AC-17).

			"DEVELOP commits them later (D3 is where missing/uncommitted artifacts become a hold).\n\n" +
			"What you check at D1 — every item below is a real P592–P607 failure mode you must call out by name when found:\n" +
			"  1. AC ACCRETION: list_criteria + read the design body. If the body says \"AC-N supersedes AC-M\" or \"Addendum X declares Y VOID\" while AC-M is still a live row in proposal_acceptance_criteria, that's a hard hold — DEVELOP cannot follow two contradictory ACs. Cite both item_numbers and require delete_criteria.\n" +
			"  2. PHANTOM COLUMNS in EXISTING tables: any column the design names on a table that already exists must appear in information_schema.columns. (Columns the design proposes to add via its own migration are fine — those don't exist yet by definition.)\n" +
			"  3. INTERNAL CONTRADICTION: scan the design for sync-vs-async, two hash formulas, two table-name lists, conflicting type signatures. Pick-one-and-delete-the-other is the only valid resolution; annotation prose (\"VOID\", \"superseded\") with both versions still present = hold.\n" +
			"  4. DEAD VOCABULARY: a CHECK constraint that hardcodes a literal list while a sibling table claims to be the canonical vocabulary = hold (the table enforces nothing).\n" +
			"  5. MISSING GRANTS in the proposed migration: if an AC requires UPDATE on a column, the migration's GRANT block must include UPDATE. Read the migration that the proposal SHIPS, not what's already in the repo.\n" +
			"  6. INVALID FK TARGETS: when the design declares `REFERENCES schema.table(col)` against a table that already exists, verify (col) is the PK or a UNIQUE column; if it doesn't exist or isn't unique, hold.\n\n" +
			"What you DO NOT check at D1 (these are D3 concerns — explicitly out of scope here):\n" +
			"  - Whether the migration / DDL / TS / test files have been committed to a branch (git ls-files / git log --all). They don't have to exist yet at DRAFT.\n" +
			"  - Whether the implementation runs, the tests pass, or the spending log shows actual cost.\n" +
			"  - Whether unrelated proposals' artifacts are floating in the worktree (worktree hygiene is an ops concern, not a spec concern).\n" +

			"  - Cross-proposal coherence: FK targets, shared schemas, role names, env vars match what sibling proposals expect.\n" +
			"  - Rollback / migration safety: destructive operations are reversible or explicitly accepted.\n" +
			"  - Cost / capacity envelope: any new index, table, or function is sized for current traffic.\n\n" +

			"  - ARTIFACT EXISTENCE: every file the design promised must be tracked. Verify with `git log --all -- <path>` returning ≥1 SHA. Untracked files = hold.\n" +
			"  - MIGRATION SLOT COLLISIONS: the migration file's slot number must not be taken by another committed migration. Verify against the migrations directory.\n" +
