## AgentHive — Claude Code Instructions

**This is a thin shim. Read `CONVENTIONS.md` for the full canonical source.**

### Quick Reference

| File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CONVENTIONS.md** | Canonical source — workflow, MCP, DB, Git, governance. Read this first. |
| AGENTS.md | Codex-specific quirks + pointer to CONVENTIONS.md |
| agentGuide.md | Retired. Content merged into CONVENTIONS.md. |

### Claude-Specific Notes

- **Host policy:** Only `nous+xiaomi` models on this host. Anthropic models are forbidden.
- **MCP:** `http://127.0.0.1:6421/sse` (SSE transport). System crontab at `/etc/cron.d/agenthive-reporting`.
- **DB topology (target):** `hiveCentral` for control plane + one DB per project tenant (`agenthive`, `monkeyKing-audio`, `georgia-singer`, …). See CONVENTIONS.md §6.0.
- **DB today (transition):** still single-DB `agenthive@127.0.0.1:5432`, user `xiaomi`. Schema-qualify with `roadmap.` Until P429 lands, treat the live DB as both control plane and the agenthive tenant.
- **Project resolution:** when adding code that needs project-scoped data, use `config.getProjectDb(slug)` (post-P474). Do NOT add `WHERE project_id = $1` filters to control-plane tables — `project_id` is a tenant-DB pointer, not a row discriminator.
- **Worktree:** Use CWD-based convention, not hardcoded paths. Sibling worktree resolved from CWD.
- **Services:** Need `sudo` to restart. Code changes must be merged to `main` for services to see them.
- **Hotfix workflow:** See CONVENTIONS.md section 5 (Hotfix Workflow) and section 15 (Escalation Matrix) for terminal states and escape paths.
- **Web bundle:** Use `npm run build:web` for the dashboard-web bundle (`src/web/main.js`). The script forces CWD to repo root and rejects dual-React. Never hand-run `bun build src/web/main.tsx` from a worktree — see CONVENTIONS.md §8a.

### Repo Context

- Project root: `CWD`
- Main project: `/data/code/AgentHive`
- MCP server: `http://127.0.0.1:6421/sse`
- GitLab: `gitlab.local` (SSH needs config for user `xiaomi`)
- Shared operator host: `bot`
- Use `AGENTHIVE_HOST=bot` when the current machine is the shared CLI/operator host. The physical host may run Codex, Claude, Hermes, or Copilot-backed spawns, but the child route must still come from the DB-resolved model route and host policy.
- Host policy is shared-host, route-specific. Do not treat `bot` as a single-provider host; use `roadmap.host_model_policy` to decide which route providers are allowed.
